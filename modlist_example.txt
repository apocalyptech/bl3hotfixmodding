### Modlist for Borderlands 3 Hotfix Injection
###
### This file is used with the mitmproxy-based hotfix injection system
### available at https://github.com/apocalyptech/bl3hotfixmodding
### 
### This is the only method of BL3 Modding that's available to Linux
### users, but Windows users will probably be better off using
### c0dycode's B3HM project, which does *not* use this file at all.
### Information on that can be found at:
###
###     http://borderlandsmodding.com/bl3-running-mods/
###
### For any Linux users out there, though, here's the file syntax:
###
### Any line with a # in front of it is ignored, so you can use those
### to comment the file however you like.  (There is nothing special
### about using three of them; it just makes it more noticeable so I
### use it for section headings.)
###
### Any line that *doesn't* start with a # mark will be loaded in as
### a mod.  If you specify an absolute path (starting with something
### like `C:\` on Windows, or `/` on Linux), that full path will be
### used.  If not, the file will be loaded relative to this file.
### In the examples below, for instance, a bunch of mods from both
### `Apocalyptech` and `SSpyR` are being loaded.
###
### To disable a mod (but keep it in the file in case you want to
### enable it again later), just prefix the filename with a # mark,
### to turn the line into a comment (you'll see plenty of examples
### of that, below, too).
###
### You can also include other modlist files, if you wanted to be able
### to easily enable/disable groups of mods all at once.  To do so,
### start a line with `!include` -- see an example at the end of this
### file.
###
### NOTE: This file is just an example!  Feel free to edit this
### however you like; the mods you might want to use are entirely up
### to you!  We've just included a few mods which provide bugfixes
### and Quality-of-Life improvements, and left out the majority of
### mods available in this repo.
