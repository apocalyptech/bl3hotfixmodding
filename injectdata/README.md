Where Have The Mods Gone?
=========================

Apocalyptech's collection of Borderlands 3 mods *used* to live here, but
they don't anymore.

Instead, go check out the shiny new [bl3mods github repo](https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods)
served from the main BLCM github area.

Also, feel free to browse the also-shiny new [BL3 ModCabinet Wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods/wiki)
which makes it easy to browse through BL3 mods by a variety of authors,
once more people start submitting mods to it.
